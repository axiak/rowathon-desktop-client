Rowathon Desktop Client
=======================

This is the repository housing the rowathon desktop client.

The CrunchTime rowathon, http://www.crunchtimerowathon.com/, is a
Boston area competition to raise money for the 
<a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/">Boston Children's Hospital</a>.

Goal
----

The basic objectives of the desktop client is to send the distance
information from the ergometer (Erg) to the web service hosted in
https://github.com/axiak/rowathon-service

Desktop Frameworks
------------------

There are several options for developing desktop applications for
talking to the rower machines

*  Java with SWT
*  Java with Swing
*  C++ with wxwidgets
*  Python with wxwidgets
*  wxRuby

I'm leaning towards Python with wxwidgets, for a few reasons:

1.  Python is a rapid language to prototype in
2.  I know python very well
3.  Python has cross platform access to the serial port (rules out java)
4.  Cross platform (py2exe bundles it as an exe file)
5.  wxWidgets means that the UI will be responsive as it's using OS widgets
